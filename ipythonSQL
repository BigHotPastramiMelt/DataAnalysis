# how to query and save query output

import pandas as pd

result = wrds.sql('select count(*) from WCAI.pos_ordersale') # sample query
print(result.to_string()) # prints query
result.to_csv('count.csv') # saves output as a csv

ls # shows that 'count.csv' is in your directory

exit #exit ipython. In home directory, 'ls' will also show count.csv. From here, you can use any editor (e.g. nano) if you want to edit the csv
